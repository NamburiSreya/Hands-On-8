Data Structures Implementation in Python


This project implements four fundamental data structures in Python, adhering to specific requirements to simulate C-style programming within Python. The implementations focus on using fixed-size arrays and integer data types.

Quickselect (ith order statistic)
I implemented the Quickselect algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array. This algorithm is based on the partitioning method used in Quicksort. It efficiently finds the kth order statistic without fully sorting the array.

Stack
I created a stack implementation using a fixed-size array. The stack supports basic operations such as push, pop, and peek. It also includes methods to check if the stack is empty or full.

Queue
The queue is implemented using a fixed-size circular array. This approach allows for efficient space utilization. The implementation includes enqueue and dequeue operations, as well as methods to check if the queue is empty or full.

Singly Linked List (Array-based)
I implemented a singly linked list using arrays to simulate the linked structure. This approach mimics how a linked list might be implemented in C using arrays instead of pointers. The implementation includes operations for inserting elements, deleting elements, and displaying the list.

Key Features:
All implementations use fixed-size arrays to store data.
The data structures are designed to work with integers only.
Each implementation includes basic error handling for overflow and underflow conditions.
The code demonstrates the usage of each data structure with example operations.


By implementing these data structures in this way, I've demonstrated an understanding of how these fundamental data structures work at a lower level, similar to C-style programming, while still using Python syntax.

This approach helps in understanding memory management and the underlying mechanics of these data structures, which is often abstracted away in higher-level Python implementations.
